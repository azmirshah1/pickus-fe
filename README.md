## Pickus new design

After Pickus 1.0, the development team started looking for ideas to create a platform that looked fresh. Among the problems to be solved are in terms of user-friendly, branding and also user flow.

We designed it using Figma and build it using Bootstrap powered by HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
